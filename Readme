Make sure to import all necessary libraries

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np 
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder, StandardScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier



Load data and code to jupyter notebook and place in one folder and run the code

data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

I have loaded dataset as both .csv and .xls (But .csv is downloading as .xls in my system - if issue exists after downloading in your system, please rename as csv and run the code)

Sorry for the inconvinience but I was not sure what is causing this


You can also load excel file to jupyer also if csv doesn't work

data = pd.read_excel('data.xls)
